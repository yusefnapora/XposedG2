## XposedG2
### An [Xposed Framework](https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge) Mod for the LG G2 stock ROM.

This mod bundles a lot of customizations that I feel make the G2 more pleasant to use. All mods are independently selectable, so you can customize your device as you like it.  As of now, the available options are:

* Recent Apps Key
    * Change either the Menu key or the Notification Toggle to Recent Apps
* Long-press on Home behavior
    * Make a long-press on Home act as either the Menu key or a Notification Toggle key
* ActionBar Overflow Menu
    * Force apps to display the vertical ellipsis ActionBar overflow menu
* Change Navigation Bar size
* Hide AM/PM indicator in status bar clock
* Black status bar
* Change Verizon's pink navigation bar theme to solid black
* Hide carrier labels in the notification panel and/or lock screen
* Hide NFC status bar icon
* Hide headset status bar icon
* Hide GPS status bar icon
* Hide mobile data status bar icon when connected to WiFi

As of this writing, these have only been tested on a Verizon device running Scott's CleanROM, but I think they should work on AT&T devices as well, and hopefully T-Mobile and international versions.  Please open an issue if something doesn't work correctly on your device, and I'll try to look into it (time permitting).
